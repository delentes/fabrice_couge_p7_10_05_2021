Clone this repo.
From within the Backend, run `npm install`. 
You can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`.
If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

From within the frontend, run `npm install`
run `npm install` vuejs with `npm run serve`.
Go to `http: // localhost: 8080 /`
